      <h2><span> ABOUT </span></h2>
      <p>
        BUN BUN BAKE SHOP was created in 2005 with the hopes of spreading
        happiness one bun at a time! We started selling buns from our home
        kitchen before establishing our Pittsburgh location. This is currently a
        family business and we oversee every step of the production process in
        order to deliver high quality cinnamon buns. Only the cleanest
        ingredients are used and we avoid natural flavorings. We provide a
        variety of cinnamon buns that are baked fresh daily.

        Due to the current pandemic we are no longer allowing in-store dining.
        However, we are still open for pick-up and delivery to select Pittsburgh
        areas! Come visit us!
