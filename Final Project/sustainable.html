                Creating Composite Blocks Using Debris Material<br>
                <br>
                How can reconstruction post-natural disaster become 
                more sustainable?<br>
                <br>
                The majority of debris material are sent to landfills 
                following a natural disaster. But this is an inefficient choice 
                because much of the debris material can be recycled to 
                create new building material.

				The scope of the project revolved around designing a method to aid in sustainable reconstruction. Much of the debris 
                post-natural disaster are sent to landfills and this is both inefficient and unsustainable. But debris on the ground can 
                be recycled. Recycling debris lessens the need for the use of new raw material. The design our team developed 
                involved a variation of one of the most common building materials in the world; concrete blocks. But instead of using 
                new concrete, our team worked to find ways to incorporate debris material creating a composite block. The block 
                consists of recycled wood, plastic, and concrete. We developed eight recipes that used varying amounts of each 
                aggregate to determine which composite brick would be the most comparable to conventional blocks.

				After developing eight distinct recipes, our team spent hours in the concrete lab executing these recipes and 
                physically creating the different composite bricks. Our experiment followed the principles of a factorial 
                experiment. This allows us to compare variables against each other to understand which variable is producing 
                what type of results. In the chart above, cement and sand are new materials because they cannot be collected 
                from ground debris. We then change the percentage of wood, plastic, recycled concrete, and water/cement ratio 
                to determine which combination of percentages results in the most ideal building block.

				The final step in this process was to test our final product. We returned to where we did our initial observation and 
                asked students to test out our portable lap desk. The biggest feedback that we desired was concerning the sliding 
                mechanism. This is what justifies the two piece design as opposed to already existing lap desks. In addition to testing 
                the sliding mechanism, we wanted to make sure that the maximum weight of items the desk could withstand was an 
                appropriate number. This design was completely user-driven from beginning to end. To see users testing our design 
                and seeing needs being met was a rewarding step in the process.
