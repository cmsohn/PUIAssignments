                    <br>
                    How might we help students work productively in 
                    non-traditional desk settings? <br>
                    <br>
                    Our team noticed that students across campus were doing 
                    their work in uncomfortable positions when traditional 
                    desks were not available. Slick, a portable lap desk that 
                    fits easily into any backpack, is our solution to this 
                    problem space.

                In order to do our user observation and confirm our initial thoughts, our team headed out to the lake. 
                We made sure to choose a day where the weather was nice, because this is when students are most inclined 
                to work outside. We were not disappointed to find that most students were indeed doing their work hunched 
                over in uncomfortable positions. In addition to visually observing the working students, we also asked 
                several questions about working in a non-traditional desk setting. Mainly the questions centered around what 
                material or aspect of a lap desk would be most convenient for a student. We then took these answers into 
                consideration when creating our prototypes and subsequent iterations.

                After our first observation, we noticed a few key points that influenced our design decisions. Something that we did 
                not account for was the role of height of each individual person when they hunch down. We realized that we couldnâ€™t 
                create a one size lap desk if our goal was for students to be more comfortable and not have to hunch down. This 
                consideration allowed us to create a design that deviated away from the traditional lap desks. We created a two piece 
                desk with a sliding mechanism. This allows the user to adjust the height of the desk to meet his or her needs. The two 
                pieces of the desk relies on a strong magnetic strip to slide up and down.

                The final step in this process was to test our final product. We returned to where we did our initial observation and 
                asked students to test out our portable lap desk. The biggest feedback that we desired was concerning the sliding 
                mechanism. This is what justifies the two piece design as opposed to already existing lap desks. In addition to testing 
                the sliding mechanism, we wanted to make sure that the maximum weight of items the desk could withstand was an 
                appropriate number. This design was completely user-driven from beginning to end. To see users testing our design 
                and seeing needs being met was a rewarding step in the process.
